## General Information

We built this site first and foremost with security in mind. Utilizing JWT and bcrypt, user passwords are hashed before being stored on our server, ensuring that they are the only user that has access to their information (such as order history and personal contact information) and only they may add, edit, or remove items from their cart.

## Technologies Used

-HTML
-CSS
-Javascript
-Express
-Node
-React
-React Router
-PostgreSQL
-JWT
-Bcrypt

## Features

All users are able to:
- View and search for different styles of glasses frames.
- Add, remove, and edit items in a persistent individual cart.
Administrators are able to:
- View a list of all users in order to verify order information.
- Add, edit, or remove product listings from the website.
